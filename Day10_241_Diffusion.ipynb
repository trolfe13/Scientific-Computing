The conservative property that flows can be the moles of ions in a solution, or the thermal energy of atoms in a material, or the mass of [regolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith) on a hillside.\n","\n","In the study of transport phenomena, the amount of the property in question that flows per unit area per unit time is called a flux ($q$).

Consider a domain in $x, t$ space as the region in which we seek a solution to our 1-D diffusion equation. In reality the solution is a continuous surface, but in numerical solutions the space-time plane is discretized into a set of points.\n","\n","The points do not have to be at equal intervals, but for simplicity we will take the space step as a constant $\\Delta x$ and the time step as a constant $\\Delta t$.\n","\n","Thus, points in $x$ and $t$ lie at $x = j\\Delta x$ and $n\\Delta t$ where $j = 1, 2, 3, ..., J$ (with $J$ the maximum value of $j$) and $n = 1, 2, 3, ... , N$ (with $N$ the maximum value of $n$).\n","\n","So, if we have a total length $L$, by choosing a spacial step size of $\\Delta x$, we see $J = \\frac{L}{\\Delta x}$.

The scheme uses the forward Euler Method in time and the Central Difference method in space to solve the partial differential equation.
