One such distribution is called a [Poisson Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution). The Poisson distribution expresses the probability of a given number of events occuring during a set time interval, given that events are *independent* from each other. This means that just because two events occured close together does not mean subsequent events will also occur close together.\n","\n","The average number of events to occur in the time interval is represented by $\\lambda$. Using $\\lambda$, we can calculate the probability of $k$ events occuring using the probability mass function:\n","\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","P(k;\\lambda) &= \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} \\tag{1}\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","\n","Where $k$ is the observed number of counts and $k$ is the average for a set time interval. Just FYI, the left-hand-side of Eequation 1 reads:\n","\n","*The probability of observing k events given an average $\\lambda$ is equal to ...*\n","\n","A great example of where a Poisson distribion occurs in nature is in [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay), where unstable atomic nuclei lose energy by emitting radiation. There is a lot of physics we could go into regarding radioactivity, but it is enough to know that radioactive decay is a random process where decay events are independent of prior decay events. As long as the half-life of the substance is \"long enough\", we should be able to measure a Poisson distribution by monitoring the counts using a radiation monitor.\n","\n","This lab has two parts. In part 1, we will investigate the random nature of radioactive decay by using a radiation monitor and a radioactive sample (do not worry, we will be fine as long as we don't eat it). We will collect radiation count data and evaluate whether our observations match the expected Poisson distribution. In part 2, we will evaulate radioactive decay count data and find the half-life ($t_{{1}/{2}}$) of the radioactive element.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"j9Rxz7uWPYt2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Part 1: The Poisson Distribution\n","\n","We want to observe the decay counts from a radioactive sample and evaluate the resulting distribution for a match to a Poisson distribution.
